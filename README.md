# Subtract


1. It should have two buttons. Clicking on first button should subtract 1, and
   second button should add 1 to the given number (the application state
   variable).
2. The number you use for mathematical operations, should not exceed 150 at any
   case. The lowest possible value can be 0. (num >= 0 && num <= 150).
3. Create a Progress Bar based on the number such that if I add or subtract
   from the number, it should reflect on the progress bar (progress bar should
   update accordingly).
4. Add transition/animation to the progress bar.
5. Implement Undo/Redo for the mathematical operations.
